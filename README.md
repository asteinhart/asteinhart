### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Austin Steinhart (he/him) and I am a [Computer Science and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) graduate student at the University of Chicago. I am interested in civic tech, data journalism, and empowering local communities with data and technology.

See my portfolio at [austinsteinhart.com](https://austinsteinhart.com/).

I am currently a writer and developer with the [Chicago Maroon](https://chicagomaroon.com/staff_name/austin-steinhart/), the university's independent student newspaper, and a research engineer with the [Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation](https://miurban.uchicago.edu/). Previously, I served as a Data Science Journalism Fellow with the Mansueto Institute's [Local Data Journalism Initiative](https://miurban.uchicago.edu/opportunities/local-data-journalism-initiative/") researching bus service across the city of Chicago. Before that, I worked on the analytics team at the Democratic National Committee and led youth programming at [Changeist](https://www.changeist.org/).
