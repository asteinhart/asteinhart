### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Austin Steinhart (he/him) and I am a [Computer Science and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) graduate student at the University of Chicago. I am interested in civic tech, data journalism, and empowering local communities with data and technology.

I am currently a writer and developer with the [Chicago Maroon](https://github.com/chicagomaroon/data-visualizations), the university's independent student newspaper. For this upcoming summer, I was selected as a Data Science Journalism Fellow with the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation's [Local Data Journalism Initiative](https://miurban.uchicago.edu/opportunities/local-data-journalism-initiative/"). Previously, I worked on the analytics team at the Democratic National Committee. Before that, I lead youth programming at [Changeist](https://www.changeist.org/).
